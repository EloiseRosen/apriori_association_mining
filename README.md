# apriori_association_mining

### CS 498 cloud computing group project 

Association mining can be used on retail data to identify pairs of items that are frequently purchased together. However, association mining is an iterative technique that is often programmed with nested loops, and thus may require prohibitively long periods of time on very large retail data sets. We implement association mining with MapReduce and the apriori algorithm in order to mine large datasets more quickly.
